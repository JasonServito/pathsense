/**
 * Unit tests for Announcement ordering.
 *
 * AudioFeedbackManager uses a PriorityQueue<Announcement> to decide what to say
 * next. The ordering contract is:
 *   1. Higher priority first (IMMEDIATE > HIGH > NORMAL > LOW)
 *   2. Within the same priority, earlier timestamp first (FIFO)
 *
 * A regression here would silently starve critical alerts or reorder speech
 * in ways blind users would experience as random — hence the explicit tests.
